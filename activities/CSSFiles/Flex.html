            <li>What you learned about Flex and CSS.
                i learned that flex is a way to create a flexible layout for your website. It allows you to easily align and distribute elements within a container, making it easier to create responsive designs. With flex, you can control the direction, alignment, and spacing of your elements, which can help improve the overall user experience of your website.

            <li>How far did you get on your Flex Box Froggy Game or What did you learn on your own?
                I did reach level 10 of the Flex Box Froggy Game. I learned how to use flex properties such as justify-content, align-items, and flex-direction to position the frogs correctly on the lily pads. It was a fun way to practice and understand how flexbox works in CSS.
