         <li>What is the difference between block tags and inline tags? 
            The block tags are used to create larger sections of content, while inline tags are used to format smaller pieces of content within a block. Block tags typically start on a new line and take up the full width of their container, while inline tags do not start on a new line and only take up as much width as necessary. Examples of block tags include div, p, and h1 while examples of inline tags include span,a,and strong.
         </li>
         <li>What is the margin, border, and padding?
            Margin is the space outside the border of an element, while padding is the space between the content of an element and its border. The border is the line that surrounds an element and can be styled with different colors, widths, and patterns. Together, margin, border, and padding create the box model in CSS, which determines how elements are sized and spaced on a web page.
            </li>
            <li>What are units of measurement you can use in CSS?
            In CSS, you can use various units of measurement to specify the size and spacing of elements. Some common units include pixels (px), which are fixed units; percentages (%), which are relative to the parent element; em and rem, which are relative to the font size; and viewport units (vw and vh), which are relative to the size of the viewport. Each unit has its own use case depending on the design requirements of the web page.
            </li>
            <li>When would you use a figure tag? 
            The figure tag is used to group media content, such as images, illustrations, diagrams, or code snippets, along with their captions. It provides a semantic way to associate the media with its description, making it easier for screen readers and search engines to understand the content. You would use a figure tag when you want to include an image or other media in your web page and provide a caption that describes or explains the media.
