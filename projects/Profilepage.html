    <h2> Hello, my name is Russel Ofalda</h2>
    <p> You can call me <mark>Russ</mark>. I was born on month of May 22, 1999 In Quezon Province in the Philippines. I study there until I finish my 4th grade. I continue 5th Grade at Camarines Norte which is part of bicol region until I graduated in year 2019. I serve mission in Philippines Olongapo mission in 2021 till 2023. After I finish my two years mission I did land a job in a construction firm where I was working with the Engineer to support them managing all the reciepts and inventory of the company addition on the job is to operate one of the machine and load the ready cement on the truck and deliver it to the site of work where they build bridges. 5 months later I quit the job not because the paycheck is not good but the sole reason is I enrolled in a program of the Church called BYU pathway. I started online school around September and finish around March at the same time I took the ELAT exam which is reqiured to get admit at <abbr title = "Brigham Young University Hawaii"> BYU-Hawaii</abbr></abbr>.</p>
